      let lyrics = `Its always been a mystery to me,
      How two hearts can come together,
      And love can last forever.
      Now that I have found you I believe,
      That a miracle has come when God sends the perfect one.
      Now gone are all my questions about why,
      And i've never been so sure of anything in my life

      Oh I wonder what God was thinking, when he created you.
      I wonder if He knew everything I would need,
      Because he made all my dreams come true.
      When God made you, He must have been thinking about me.

      I promise that wherever you may go, wherever life may lead you,
      With all my heart I'll be there too.
      And from this moment on I want you to know,
      I'll let nothing come between us, and I will love the ones you love.
      Now gone are all my questions about why
      And I've never been so sure of anything in my life
      Oh I wonder what God was thinking when he created you,
      I wonder if He knew everythin I would need,
      Because He made all my dreams come true.
      When God made you, He must have been thinking about me.
      He made the sun, he made the moon
      To harmonize the perfect tune
      One can't do without the other they just have to be together.
      And that is how I know its true,
      Youre for me and i'm for you
      And my world just cant be right
      Without you in my life

      Oh I wonder what God was thinking, when he created you.
      I wonder if He knew everything I would need,

      Because he made all my dreams come true.
      He must have heard every prayer I've been praying.
      He must've knew everything I would need

      When God made you,

      When dremas came true ...
      When God made you, He must've been thinking

      About me. `;
